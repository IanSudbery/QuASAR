# QuASAR-MPRA: Accurate allele-specific analysis for massively parallel  reporter assays
We have further developed our method for allele specific analysis QuASAR (quantitative allele-specific analysis of reads) ([Harvey et al, 2015]) to analyze allele specific signals in barcoded read counts data from MPRAs. Using this approach, we can take into account the uncertainty on the original plasmid proportions, over-dispersion, and sequencing errors. Here, we demonstrate how to use QuASAR-MPRA to analyze the MPRA data by [Tewhey et al,2016].

The current software is still in development and we will kindly appreciate any comments and bug reports. We assume that you allready have installed the QuASAR library. The [mpra.R] script contains the instructions to run the test.
